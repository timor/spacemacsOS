** Description
The time has arrived when one can finally use Emacs as a Window Manager, long
ago the concepts of *windows* and *frames* made so much sense when one was
working in a TTY, and basically that's all the window management you got. In
these *modern* times though, it sounds silly to have those names. But not
Anymore!

Thanks to @ch11ng and his [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] project we can now use Emacs as our window
manager, and all those *windows* that didn't make sense before, now can not only
hold buffers, but X Windows, that means that you can spawn a Browser Window, or
your music player, or anything.

I urge you to read the [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki][EXWM Wiki]] for a more in depth explanation and if you can
contribute, please do so! The purpose of me making this layer is that I find it
awesome and having nice defaults would make more people dive into it and the
project would receive more attention and contributions which will only make it
more awesome, so if you try it and like it, share it!

This is how it looks like:

** Install
To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(exwm))
#+end_src

*** Note about Display Managers

This is most common among Ubuntu and derivative users:

LightDM, GDM, and other Display managers that need a session file will need you
to copy the [[file:files/exwm.desktop][desktop file]] I bundled with this layer to
~/usr/local/xsessions/exwm.desktop~, that's what I used on my Ubuntu box, but
make sure the [[file:files/exwm-start][exwm-start script]] is in your PATH, you can put it in
~/usr/local/bin/exwm-start~ and that should be enough, next time you log out,
select the EXWM session instead of the Ubuntu one and you should be alright.

*** Not having Display Managers

If you use Arch, Gentoo, or any other Linux, most probably you'll start your
configurations via a ~.xinitrc~ file, just append ~exwm-start~ to the end of
that file and you should be fine. I do recommend to check the [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki][EXWM Wiki]] for more
details.

*** OSX

If you are an OSX user, please report back on whether this works with xQuartz,
always back up your data before attempting to try stuff like this.

** Key bindings

As other window managers the ~s~ or *Super* key (Windows Key) is the one that
is the prefix to every action. We'll use a lot of ~s~.

I have, for convenience, disabled the use of ~C-x~ and ~C-c~ in X windows,
mainly because that's something we could use for Cutting and Copying text, but if
you want you can enable it, this layer focuses on less Emacs-y bindings.

| Key Binding           | Description                                    |
|-----------------------+------------------------------------------------|
| ~C-q~                 | Send next key pressed to the X window          |
| ~C-g~                 | Universal GetMeOuttaHere Key from Emacs        |
| ~C-u~                 | Universal Argument                             |
| ~C-[0-9]~             | Universal Prefix for [0-9]                     |
| ~SPC~                 | Spacemacs Leader Key (in line mode)            |
| ~i~                   | Switch to EXWM char mode                       |
| ~s-[1 2 3 ... 8 9 0]~ | Switch to workspace [1 2 3 ... 8 9 10]         |
| ~s-TAB~               | Switch to last workspace                       |
| ~s-w~                 | Workspace Switch Menu (kinda like micro-state) |
| ~s-ESC~               | Reset window state (gets you out of char mode) |
| ~s-r~                 | App Launcher                                   |
| ~s-l~                 | Lock Screen                                    |
| ~s-u,U~               | Undo, Redo window configurations               |
| ~s-b~                 | Select and switch to buffer                    |
| ~s-h,j,k,l~           | Switch to left,lower,upper,right window        |
| ~s-H,J,K,L~           | Move window to far left,down,lower,upper,right |
| ~M-s-h,j,k,l~         | Resizing (try them, it's too hard to explain)  |
| ~s-[,]~               | Switch to prev,next workspace                  |

** Window behaviour regarding char and line mode

EXWM X windows come up in line mode per default. This means that except for the
special keys listed above, all keys are sent to the window, and normal evil mode
bindings are overridden. Pressing ~s-i~, which would normally get you into insert
mode, releases all bindings except the ones starting with ~s~, or *Super*,
effectively giving full control to the X window. To switch back to line mode,
use ~s-r~.

*** Implementation Strategy
Generally, whenever a EXWM window is created, it is displayed in line mode, with
spacemacs being in normal state.  When changing to insert-state in EXWM mode,
char mode should be activated underneath.  When exiting char mode, either by use
of =exwm-reset= or =exwm-input-grab-keyboard=, the window should return to
normal state.

Switching to input-state/char mode:
- bind "i" to switch to insert state as usual, but also activate char mode.
- advice =exwm-input-grab-keyboard= so that normal state is activated when
  control is given back to spacemacs.

Handling transient states from line mode:
Transient states are not captured by EXWM's intrinsic
"currently-inputting-command" detection, and must be activated separately.
- add hook to all hydra show functions that enable EXWM input pass-through
  behaviour
- add hook to all hydra deactivate functions that disable EXWM input
  pass-through

Handling transient states from char mode:
This is a bit more tricky, since char mode has no input-tunneling behavior.
There is an EXWM-internal mechanism to temporarily enable line mode, but that is
an implementation detail and not exposed in the interface.
- add hook to all hydra show functions that store which mode (char/line) was
  active during hydra activation
- switch to line mode
- proceed as described above
- add hook such that whenever the buffer is re-entered, the previous mode is
  restored.  This is necessary because hydra command execution could have exited
  the window, and the next time the window is entered, the original mode should
  be restored.  Alternatively, if that proves to be to messy, hydra activation
  could always be made to change the state back to normal state.
