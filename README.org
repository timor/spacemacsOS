** Description

*Fork Note:*  This layer is based on CestDiego's PR from
https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/pull/3321.

The time has arrived when one can finally use Emacs as a Window Manager, long
ago the concepts of *windows* and *frames* made so much sense when one was
working in a TTY, and basically that's all the window management you got. In
these *modern* times though, it sounds silly to have those names. But not
Anymore!

Thanks to @ch11ng and his [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] project we can now use Emacs as our window
manager, and all those *windows* that didn't make sense before, now can not only
hold buffers, but X Windows, that means that you can spawn a Browser Window, or
your music player, or anything.

I urge you to read the [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki][EXWM Wiki]] for a more in depth explanation and if you can
contribute, please do so! The purpose of me making this layer is that I find it
awesome and having nice defaults would make more people dive into it and the
project would receive more attention and contributions which will only make it
more awesome, so if you try it and like it, share it!

This is how it looks like:

** Install
To use this contribution,
- place this repository in one of Spacemacs' layer directories
  (~/.emacs.d/private/local/exwm, ~/.spacemacs.d/private/exwm, or ~/.spacemacs.d/layers/exwm)
- add an entry ~exwm~ for the layer in your =~/.spacemacs=, optionally set some
  configuration variables:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers ...
  (exwm :variables
         exwm-enable-systray t
         exwm-autostart-xdg-applications t
         exwm-locking-command "i3lock -n"
         exwm-install-logind-lock-handler t
         exwm-terminal-command "st"
         exwm-custom-init (lambda() (exwm/autostart-process "Dunst OSD" "dunst")))
  ;; )
#+end_src

*** Note about Display Managers

This is most common among Ubuntu and derivative users:

LightDM, GDM, and other Display managers that need a session file will need you
to copy the [[file:files/exwm.desktop][desktop file]] I bundled with this layer to
~/usr/local/xsessions/exwm.desktop~, that's what I used on my Ubuntu box, but
make sure the [[file:files/exwm-start][exwm-start script]] is in your PATH, you can put it in
~/usr/local/bin/exwm-start~ and that should be enough, next time you log out,
select the EXWM session instead of the Ubuntu one and you should be alright.

*** Not having Display Managers

If you use Arch, Gentoo, or any other Linux, most probably you'll start your
configurations via a ~.xinitrc~ file, just append ~exwm-start~ to the end of
that file and you should be fine. I do recommend to check the [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki][EXWM Wiki]] for more
details.

*** OSX

If you are an OSX user, please report back on whether this works with xQuartz,
always back up your data before attempting to try stuff like this.

** Features
Configurable support for optional EXWM features:

- System Tray

The following features are preconfigured/provided on top of EXWM:

- EXWM buffer names are prefixed with a configurable prefix (default: ~X:~), to
  aid buffer selection in ivy/helm.
- Limited Support for XDG autostart applications in =~/.config/autostart= (does
  not support any advanced ~.desktop~ file entries, does not take into account
  system-wide ~share/applications/autostart~ files)
- Session locking with specified lock command
- Support for D-Bus based locking (e.g. ~loginctl lock-session~)
- Optionally use [[https://github.com/DamienCassou/desktop-environment][~desktop-environment~]] to support special keys for things like
  audio volume control or brightness control (except for locking)
- Uses ~framemove~ to enable navigation between frames by using window
  navigation at frame borders.  Can be disabled by setting
  ~exwm-move-frame-at-edge~ to ~nil~.

*** RandR
Experimental support for
[[https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr][autorandr]] is enabled with
~exwm-use-autorandr~, which can be used to set up and handle different monitor
configuration profiles.

Note that except for calling ~autorandr -c~ in EXWM's screen-change hook, the
actual profiles have to be configured outside of Spacemacs (see ~autorandr
--help~).

This is enabled per default but will do nothing if the ~autorandr~ executable is
not found.

One tool which is useful for interactively setting up screen configurations is
[[https://christian.amsuess.com/tools/arandr/][ARandR]] (note that their save files don't have anything to with autorandr's).

(TODO: provide some bindings for =autorandr='s built-in configurations)

** Key bindings

*** Normal State Bindings

 | Key Binding        | Description                                                           |
 |--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | ~i,<down-mouse-X>~ | Switch from normal state to insert state, (similar to EXWM char mode) |

**** Major Mode Bindings

  These bindings are accessible via the major mode leader keys when EXWM buffers
  are focused, but only in normal state.  This means that you usually have to get
  out of insert state with ~s-ESC~ first.

 | Key Binding | Description                                |
 |-------------+--------------------------------------------|
 | ~SPC m f~   | Toggle floating/tiling for current window  |
 | ~SPC m w~   | Move current window to different workspace |
 | ~SPC m F~   | Toggle fullscreen                          |

*** Global Bindings

  As other window managers the ~s~ or *Super* key (Windows Key) is the one that
  is the prefix to every action. We'll use a lot of ~s~.  These commands work in
  both normal state and insert state.


 | Key Binding           | Description                                    |
 |-----------------------+------------------------------------------------|
 | ~s-SPC~               | Spacemacs Leader Key (in insert state)         |
 | ~s-[1 2 3 ... 8 9 0]~ | Switch to workspace [0 ... 9]                  |
 | ~s-[~, ~s-]~          | Switch to previous/next workspace              |
 | ~s-{~, ~s-}~          | Move current buffer to previous/next workspace |
 | ~s-TAB~               | Switch to last workspace                       |
 | ~s-c~                 | Switch to EXWM char mode                       |
 | ~s-ESC~               | Switch to normal state, cancel fullscreen      |
 | ~s-r~                 | App Launcher                                   |
 | ~s-pause~             | Lock Screen                                    |
 | ~s-<return>~          | Open (X-)Terminal                              |
 | ~s-u,U~               | Undo, Redo window configurations               |
 | ~s-b~                 | Select and switch to buffer                    |
 | ~s-q~                 | Close current buffer                           |
 | ~s-h,j,k,l~           | Switch to left,lower,upper,right window        |
 | ~s-H,J,K,L~           | Move window to far left,down,lower,upper,right |
 | ~M-s-h,j,k,l~         | Resizing (try them, it's too hard to explain)  |
 | ~s-m~                 | Toggle maximized buffer                        |
 | ~SPC T D~             | Toggle ~desktop-environment-mode~              |
 | ~s-d~                 | Toggle exwm debug mode (for development)       |

 Since running programs is one of the more common task, some explicit support is
 provided for that via the leader key ~SPC &~.

 For these commands as well as for ~s-r~ the working directory is set to the
 value of =user-home-directory= for the started process.

 | Key Binding | Description                                                               |
 |-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | ~SPC & s~   | Ask for program to run in separate window below current window            |
 | ~SPC & v~   | Ask for program to run in separate window to the right of current window. |

 *This layer overrides the leader bindings on* ~SPC F~, which are tricky with EXWM
 anyways, and replaces them with the following bindings.

 | Key Binding | Description                                |
 |-------------+--------------------------------------------|
 | ~SPC F r~   | Reset state of current window (exwm-reset) |
 | ~SPC F h~   | Hide floating window                       |
 | ~SPC F w~   | Prompt for workspace and switch to it      |
 | ~SPC F a~   | Add new workspace                          |
 | ~SPC F d~   | Delete current workspace                   |
 | ~SPC F m~   | Move Workspace to different position       |
 | ~SPC F s~   | Interchange position of two workspaces     |
 | ~SPC F M d~ | Detach Minibuffer (for autohide enabled)   |
 | ~SPC F M a~ | Attach Minibuffer (for autohide enabled)   |

* Window behaviour regarding char and line mode

  In stock Emacs, EXWM uses char mode and line mode to distinguish between using
  the keyboard to control an application vs. using the keyboard to control the
  application's *buffer*.  Since Spacemacs pursues a different concept regarding
  keybindings SpacemacsOS handles this differently:

  - EXWM buffers are used in line mode per default, all local key bindings are removed per
    default.  This corresponds to Spacemacs insert state.
  - The command ~exwm/enter-normal-state~ (default binding ~s-ESC~) enters
    EXWM's input passthrough mode, meaning that *all* key-presses are sent to
    Spacemacs, and not the application.  This corresponds to Spacemacs normal
    state.  Press ~i~ to get back to sending input to the application.
  - Certain applications (e.g. SDL based) may not work correctly with line mode,
    and register double keyboard events.  In this case, ~s-c~ can be used to
    enter EXWM char mode.  To return from that, also use ~exwm/enter-nomral-state~

* Known Limitations
  (3rd party research welcome...)

- ~s-SPC m~ does not work for accessing major mode bindings
- When clicking into a buffer in normal state to press something, it has to be
  clicked twice, because the first click only gets you into insert state
- In some cases, the Emacs GUI becomes completely unresponsive if an X window
  was opened by Emacs' foreground command loop, e.g. when emacs starts an waits
  for the return of an interactive graphical password entry dialog.  To get it
  to respond again, switch to a text console and send the SIGUSR2 signal
  (e.g. =pkill -USR2 emacs=).
- Under certain conditions, an EXWM buffer may end up in a state where Emacs
  wants to insert into the underlying buffer, and pressing ~i~ does not get you
  into insert state.  If that happens, use ~s-ESC~ to get to line mode/normal
  state, where you should be able to use ~i~ to to get into insert state again.
- `which-key` still not working correctly with ~s-SPC~ in EXWM buffers
- There are dependencies on EXWM internals:
  - ~exwm--id~
  - ~exwm--workspace-count~
  - ~exwm-workspace--workspace-from-frame-or-index~
  - ~exwm-layout--fullscreen-p~
  - ~exwm-randr--get-monitors~
- ~exwm/workspace-move-buffer-to-workspace~ is buggy.  It seems to depend on the window
  layout whether the current buffer will be moved correctly, or the current
  frame will be messed up...
- The ~autorandr~ functionality is currently extremely eager.  After any mode
  switch, the hook will be called and reset it to a known configuration, if
  found.  So any changes made using ~xrandr~ manually will be immediately
  overridden again by the hooks.
